# **Real-time Digital Filter Design**

## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Realtime Digital Filter Design, where you can craft custom digital filters with ease and precision. This desktop application empowers you to manipulate signal processing concepts through intuitive zeros-poles placement on the z-plane. Dive into the realm of digital signal processing and unleash your creativity!

## Explore Filter Design

Realtime Digital Filter Design offers a comprehensive toolkit for designing digital filters, allowing users to visualize and modify filter characteristics in real-time. From plotting the z-plane to analyzing frequency responses, this application provides a seamless interface for exploring and fine-tuning digital filters.

## Features

- ### Z-Plane Playground
  Design custom digital filters by placing zeros and poles on the z-plane. Effortlessly modify their positions, add or remove components, and adjust settings to achieve desired filter characteristics.
   
    - **Interactive Plot:** Visualize the z-plane with the unit circle and dynamically place zeros and poles.
    - **Drag and Drop:** Modify the position of zeros and poles by dragging them across the z-plane.
    - **Easy Editing:** Delete individual zeros or poles, clear all components, or customize settings for added flexibility.
  
- ### Frequency Response Analysis
  Gain insights into filter performance with real-time visualization of frequency responses. Explore magnitude and phase responses to understand filter behavior and make informed design decisions.

- ### Real-time Filtering
  Apply designed filters to lengthy signals in real-time, simulating a live filtering process. Monitor signal progress and filtered output dynamically, adjusting temporal resolution as needed for optimal performance.

- ### Phase Correction
  Fine-tune filter responses by adding All-Pass filters to correct phase distortions. Choose from a library of pre-defined All-Pass filters or create custom solutions to address specific requirements.

## Getting Started

To start designing digital filters with Realtime Digital Filter Design, follow these simple steps:

1. Install the application on your desktop.
2. Launch the application and familiarize yourself with the interface.
3. Begin by plotting zeros and poles on the z-plane to design your custom filter.
4. Analyze the frequency response to evaluate filter performance.
5. Apply the filter to real-time signals and observe the impact on signal processing.
